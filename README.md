# Hardo's Shell Configs
### These are my config files for PowerShell and Bash (maybe more in the future)

**But why my configs?**  
Well...  
I support making your own profiles as you can learn a bit of how your shell works, and the complete customisablility you will have.  
But, you could also just take my configs, and change them as you like, while having a (I think) pretty solid base to build on

#### Right now there are configs for PowerShell, Bash, and oh-my-posh:
- **[PowerShell](https://github.com/HardoMX/Shells/blob/main/PowerShell/README.md):** This profile is completely cross-compatible with both Windows and Linux and adds a lot of nice features to the standard PowerShell experience
- **[Bash]():** This bashrc just adds some very simple aliases. For full experience you should install [lsd](https://github.com/lsd-rs/lsd)
- **[oh-my-posh](https://github.com/HardoMX/Shells/blob/main/oh-my-posh/schemes.md):** On top of these simple and usefull configs, I have also made three different themes for oh-my-posh, to make your prompt beautiful
