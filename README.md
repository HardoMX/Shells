### My personal PowerShell Profile that is continuously updated 

---

#### Installation:
1. Clone repo to local computer
2. Open your Profile_1.ps1 file (can be found with `$PROFILE`)
3. Type a `.` followed by the path to the downloaded repo

This installation method allows you to easily use the profile in different ways/versions but without having to copy it a bunch of times
